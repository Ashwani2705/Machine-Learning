5. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
To avoid package conflicts in the future, I recommend setting up a virtual environment for your project.

Hereâ€™s how to create a virtual environment:

Create the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
Install the necessary packages: Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
Run your code in the virtual environment: After setting up the virtual environment, run your Python script, and the errors should be resolved.
